SpaceX
======

SpaceX is a small arcade style space shooter. It was made following a Unity tutorial by the Walker Boys Studio.

-----

The goal is to survive for 60 seconds and trying to achieve the highest score you can.
Score is increased by destroying asteroids.

-----

CONTROLS:
(Can be changed during input selection when you boot the game.)
Arrow keys are used for movement, Space Bar will fire your laser and 'E' will activate your shield.

-----

MECHANICS:
Asteroids:
Asteroids will rain down from above, they can be destroyed by one laser shot. Destroying these will increase your score.

Space Junk:
Space junk will occasionally drift across the screen, space junk will destroy asteroids and damage you if you collide with it. It CANNOT be destroyed by your laser.

Lives:
You will begin with three lives, these can be increased with a power-up. Being hit by asteroids or space junk will decrease your lives by one. If your lives go down to zero it's game over.

Tri-Cannon (Power-up):
Tri-Cannon converts your single cannon laser into three cannons. The power-up is represented by a red capsule with 'x3' printed on it, it will occasionally appear during gameplay. Being damaged will cause this power-up to end.

1-UP (Power-up):
1-UP power up gives you an extra life (suprised?) It is represented by a sparkling white crate with a red cross on it.

Shield:
You are allowed one shield per run, default key to activate it is 'E'. The shield will stop you from losing lives when you are hit by asteroids or space junk. The shield has an infinite duration but will only shield you for three hits. Having your shield hit WILL NOT cause you to lose the Tri-Cannon power-up.

NOTES:
SpaceX was made using Unity editor (http://unity3d.com/) the objects code is written in JavaScript using Unitys API.

I did not upload the raw assets of SpaceX, they would require Unity editor to view anyway. The game is fairly simple so I doubt there will be anybody really interested in seeing the code.

I would like to mention Walker Boys Studios Unity tutorials which taught me how to build the majority of this game.
If you are new to object orientated coding (or just interested in coding games using Unity) and would like to learn more I heavily recommend their tutorials, they are all free, very clear and easily accessible. You can find more about them at http://walkerboystudio.com.

Please be gentle, this is my second completed game since beginning coding.

BUGS:
I never expected the publish this game because of this I did not correct all the bugs caused by using large resolutions. When asked what resolution to use in the boot menu please just stick to around 1024x768, it's a windowed game anyway and using a larger resolution will cause your view to extend past the field of movement and you will see objects you shouldn't.

Thanks for looking at SpaceX and although it's a very simple game I hope it gives you a couple of minutes of fun. :]
